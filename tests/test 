🔗 clear_my_record_backend

To fully align with your existing ecosystem and elevate this backend into a complex intelligence-powered legal automation tool, here's a custom README.md that transforms the project into a high-level AGI-cleared record expungement system, integrated with SOAP and REST endpoints, AGI modules, and potential biometric validators.

🧹 clear_my_record_backend

🔎 Overview

clear_my_record_backend is a secure, intelligent, and automated backend service designed to assist with criminal record expungement, clemency, or record sealing requests via integrated court systems.

This stack is designed to run on private cloud, on-premise, or edge devices (Termux / Raspberry Pi), with optional KermitAGI™, RedHawkSecureLab™, and Crown Listener™ biometric intelligence enhancements.

> 💡 Ideal for social justice orgs, re-entry programs, or DMV integrations with SOAP/REST APIs.

Would you like me to:

Push this README.md into the live repo?

Package the system into a Termux install .zip?

Add biometric PDF + downlink demo?

Generate a PDF sponsorship/impact doc?


Just say: “Deploy All + ZIP + PDF Mockup” or specify the stack phase.
