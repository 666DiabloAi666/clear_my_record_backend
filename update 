1. Purpose Enhancement

Original Intent: Assist users in clearing criminal records via a backend service.
Upgrade Intent: Use AI/ML and NLP to provide smart eligibility analysis, personalized expungement strategy, and legal recommendation routing.


---

2. High-Level Architecture

Core Services (Rust + Python ML Hybrid):

Rust (Actix-Web) – High-performance secure backend for:

User auth

Document upload

Record storage

Routing/validation


Python (FastAPI) – ML/NLP backend for:

Record classification

Legal rule reasoning

Eligibility prediction

Auto-drafting expungement documents




---

3. Intelligence Modules

A. NLP-Based Record Understanding (Python)

Use spaCy or transformers (e.g., Legal-BERT) to:

Parse uploaded court documents

Extract charges, dates, jurisdictions

Normalize entities (court names, statutes)



B. Eligibility Reasoning Engine (Rule-based + ML Hybrid)

Rule-based Reasoner:

Encode jurisdiction-specific rules using durable_rules or Drools (Rust/Python hybrid)

Account for:

Type of offense

Time elapsed since disposition

Repeat offenses



ML Model:

Classify case as "Eligible", "Likely Eligible", or "Not Eligible"

Train on past legal datasets (e.g., expungement court outcomes)



C. Legal Chatbot Assistant (LLM API or Local Model)

Integrate with OpenAI/GPT or Llama for:

Natural conversation on user case status

“What should I do next?” type Q&A

Legal FAQs (dynamically customized to jurisdiction)



D. Document Auto-Generation

Generate expungement petitions using:

Jinja2 or LaTeX templating

Pre-filled fields from parsed record data

Editable by user or lawyer




---

4. Infrastructure Enhancements

Database: Upgrade to PostgreSQL with encrypted PII fields

Queue/Task Management: Use Celery (Python) or RabbitMQ for processing large legal docs

Security: End-to-end encryption, zero-knowledge file uploads

API Gateway: Rate-limited, token-auth endpoints for external integrations (e.g., law firms)



---

5. Sample User Flow
